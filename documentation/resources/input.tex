\begin{itemize}
    \item Each vertex/edge is on a separate line.
    \item Vertices are separated from edges by a line containing $---$.
    \item Vertices are put before edges.
    \item Edge has the following strucutre $<$vertex1 vertex2 direction weight capacity flow$>$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item vertex1 and vertex2 data fields are required, the others are optional. Direction can be either $---$ or $-->$. If you want to specify let's say edge capacity - you must also specify all fields before it (direction and weight). Default values for each data field is:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item direction: $---$
            \item weight: 0
            \item capacity: 0
            \item flow: 0
        \end{itemize}
        \item Edge data fields are delimeted by a single space character.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
