I would consider the following as possible improvements:\\

\begin{itemize}
    \item Remove parametrization by implementation structure from Graph object as there is no need to distinguish $Graph<int,AdjacencyList>$ and $Graph<int, IncidenceMatrix>$.
    \item Add more implementation structures.
    \item Add Push-Relabel algorithm - one of the most efficient known techniques.
    \item Extend Edmonds-Karp and Dinic to allow multiple sources and sinks.
    \item Add algorithms for min-cost flow problem.
    \item Fix drawing of directed edges in Drawer component.
    \item Beautify drawing of algorithm results in Drawer component.
\end{itemize}
